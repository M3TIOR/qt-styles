# qt-styles

The repository herein contains all of my QT-4+ stylesheets because theme consistency is amazing.

Each individual *theme*'s stylesheet will be authored within a container folder bearing the same name as the finalized style. I do plan on authoring styles based on other's theme submissions, for which I will ensure to designate proper credit to the theme's original creators in their respective stylesheet's README file. If any source code is included with a theme I am basing my QT version off of, I may include substantial portions of said source code within mine. If that is the case, I'll include the appropriate open source licensing within the container folder as well and, where applicable, annotations to the external licenses that the copied source applies to.

### Usage

If you want to compile one of these projects you'll most likely need less because
I really like that language. I've included an npm package.json to help you get
going lightning fast. just type in ```npm install .``` and it will grab your
dependencies for you. To build *"properly"*, do ```npm run-script build [Theme Name]```.

The theme's qss files will be put in the dist folder for you to pick up and distribute
as you like.
